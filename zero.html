     <p>              
                    <p>"I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like it's all my own fault. There have been many setbacks, and I <br/>
        
                     had hoped that something would work out, but I couldn't make it happen. Frustration has taken over. I wasted so much time on Facebook and etc; that's true. One thing I've realized now is that Facebook is mainly for showing off. Those who are losers, those who don't have any achievements, are just here on Facebook to watch others' success. You bought a car, a house, got married, got a job, ranked first or second in university-without these, you don't really do anything on Facebook. The main purpose is to show off.</p> 

                     <p> And honestly, the position of showing off doesn't suit me at all. I can't do anything; how will I? I don't even pay attention to what my parents say. I thought everything would be easy, but reality was different. 'When everyone used to say that all your friends would get a chance in university along with you, then you will understand how it feels.' And now It really feels.</p>


                     <p> Now, the happiness of others has become the source of my happiness. I congratulate my friends without any personal achievements. Dear good friends, please don't misunderstand me, but I'm facing reality. I genuinely feel happy for your achievements, and I would also be happy if I could achieve something alongside you. But honestly, congratulations.</p>


                     <p> Since reaching this stage of life, I feel like I'm the most useless thing in the world. I don't feel like I can contribute anything or do anything. I don't understand what to do now. It's hurting me in different ways. The biggest issue is that I wasted my time in various tasks, in various ways. Ahh, what a disaster. It feels like my parents did so much for me, and in return, I couldn't give anything.</p> 


                     <p> And thanks to all the so-called 'Durer attiyo' who set fire to everyone's family once a year. You all have children who excel, unlike others. Congratulations on your children's achievements. But please, I humbly request you not to make false accusations.</p> 
    
                     <p> Don't say things like 'Their child doesn't perform well, didn't get a chance, didn't pass the entrance exam on time, or couldn't do anything despite having so much time.' What will they do in life? Will they be able to achieve anything?</p> 


                     <p> Just because your child got a chance and we didn't doesn't mean we are useless. It doesn't mean our parents didn't put in the same effort as yours did. We tried our best. We were conscious of the consequences if we didn't get a chance. But the harsh reality is that we lost.</p>

                     <p>Do you (Durer attiyo) believe that everyone is good at something? Not everyone is the same. Not everyone excels in everything. But each and everyone is good or maybe best at something. And each parent does their best financially, physically, and mentally. So you don't have any right to blame them. The losers are us, not our parents.</p>


                     <p> If people only resort to blaming others, they tend to portray themselves in a better light, I blamed and emerged victorious.

                     This is the current picture of Bangladesh.</p>


                     <p> I would like to express my gratitude to my parents, my brothers, and my sister-in-law, and all those who have supported me during this critical moment. I will always be thankful to you.</p>


                     <p> Anyway, I'm leaving Facebook and everything else that has been wasting or will waste my time. If I can accomplish something in life, I will prove it to myself by sharing this post.</p>

 
                     <p> Currently, I have no recognition,</p>

                     <p> no achievement,</p>

                     <p> no source of income,</p>

                     <p> and no money earned by myself.</p>

                     <p> In sha Allah, I will do my best to be the best.</p>

                     <p>"Keep me in your prayers."</p>

                     <p> This is Tahsinur Rahman Tamim. Over and out. </p>
